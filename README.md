## Subreddit Discussion Sentiment Analysis
This program analyzes the sentiment of discussions on Reddit, specifically targeting new chapter discussion posts in the One Piece subreddit. It uses PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) to fetch comments from discussion threads and processes them for sentiment analysis using NPL (Natural Language Processing). The goal is to determine the overall sentiment of reactions to new chapters by leveraging AI-powered text analysis.
